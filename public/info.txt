### Key Improvements Over the Example

#### 1. **Enhanced CSS Design**
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Uses a gradient header with a subtle shadow, a clean white container with rounded corners, and a soft gray background for a professional look.
- **Typography**: Integrates Google’s Roboto font for readability and consistency.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout for mobile devices with stacked stages, labels, and buttons.
- **Tabs/Stages**: Multi-stage navigation with clickable tabs (General, Email & CAPTCHA, etc.) for better organization and less scrolling.
- **Buttons**: Rounded, animated buttons with hover effects and shadows for a tactile feel.
- **Tooltips**: Improved positioning and styling for better usability.

#### 2. **Multi-Stage Layout**
- **Stages**: Split into six logical sections:
  - General Settings (Browser & Proxy, GoLogin)
  - Email & CAPTCHA
  - Retries & Rate Limiting
  - API Settings (Content & LLM, Manual Selectors)
  - Human-Like Behavior
  - Extras
- **Navigation**: Tabs switch between stages without collapsible sections, reducing clutter and improving focus.

#### 3. **All Needed Fields**
- **Included**: Every field from your `defaultConfig` is present, including new ones like `geminiApiKey`, `twoCaptchaKey`, `sentryDsn`, and `goLoginExecutablePath`.
- **Organization**: Grouped logically within stages for intuitive use (e.g., all GoLogin settings together).

#### 4. **Multiple Config Presets**
- **Basic**: Minimal setup, no GoLogin, no stealth features—ideal for quick testing.
- **Advanced**: Adds proxy support and retries—good for reliability without complexity.
- **Stealth**: Full human-like behavior with GoLogin, Gemini, and warm-up—perfect for avoiding detection.
- **Custom**: Default settings, fully editable—allows users to tweak everything.
- **Visual Feedback**: Active preset button is highlighted with a red background.

#### 5. **Additional Features**
- **Progress Indicator**: A `<div id="progress">` at the bottom shows status updates (e.g., "Starting registration...", "Failed - error").
- **Reset Button**: Resets the form to the Basic preset, providing an easy way to start over.
- **Form Validation**: Basic parsing ensures numbers are integers and checkboxes are booleans, sent correctly to the server.

#### 6. **Usability Considerations**
- **Labels**: Clear, concise labels with tooltips explaining each field’s purpose.
- **Input Styling**: Consistent padding, borders, and focus states for a polished UI.
- **Accessibility**: Larger fonts, high contrast, and proper HTML structure for screen readers.

#### 7. **What Else Was Needed**
- **API Keys**: Added fields for `geminiApiKey` and `twoCaptchaKey` since they’re critical for your Gemini and CAPTCHA integration.
- **Error Handling**: Basic fetch error handling with user alerts and progress updates.
- **Flexibility**: The Custom preset ensures users can experiment with any combination of settings.

### How It Works
1. **Load**: The page loads with the Basic preset applied, showing the General Settings stage.
2. **Preset Selection**: Clicking a preset button (Basic, Advanced, Stealth, Custom) updates the form fields and highlights the button.
3. **Stage Navigation**: Clicking a tab switches to that stage, keeping the UI focused.
4. **Submission**: The form submits to `/start` as JSON, with a progress update and alert on success/failure.
5. **Reset**: The reset button clears changes and reapplies the Basic preset.

### Next Steps
- **Backend Sync**: Ensure your Express server handles all new fields (e.g., `geminiApiKey`, `twoCaptchaKey`) in the `/start` endpoint.
- **Testing**: Verify the UI on different screen sizes and with your backend to catch any discrepancies.
- **Enhancements**: Add real-time validation (e.g., required fields like `goLoginToken` when `useGoLogin` is checked) if needed.

This should be a significant upgrade—modern, functional, and easy to use. Let me know if you want to tweak anything further!
